                    | The search engine is located at the top right, and it allows users to search through the torrent titles available on the site. Results matching either word A or B can be included by typing a vertical bar between them (|). Results matching a certain word can be excluded by prefixing that word with a hyphen-minus (-). Phrases can be matched by surrounding them with double-quotes ("). Search results can be filtered by category, remake, trusted, and/or A+ status and then narrowed down further by age and size ranges. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order by date, amount of seeders/leechers/downloads, size, or name. The search engine adapts to the current view and makes it possible to search for specific torrents in a specific subcategory from a specific user.

                      | Torrents must be marked as remakes if any of the following applies to the release:

                      li Reencode of original release.

                    | The tools to manage your torrents are located right above the torrent's details on the information page. Editable fields are the torrent's title, category, description, information link, metadata, and the alias and key fields which are explained on the page. It is also possible to hide the torrent which prevents it from being displayed in lists or even delete it altogether.
                  dt Pseudo-Anonymous Uploading
                  dd
                    | Pseudo-anonymous uploads are torrents that will appear to be uploaded by Anonymous, but you can still manage them through your account.

                  dd
                    | Flagging torrents points them out for moderator review. Torrents can be flagged by clicking on the link located in the upper right corner of their information pages.

                  dd
                    | RSS is a useful Web feed that automatically updates when a torrent is added by a user. Many programs such as popular BitTorrent clients, which can be set up for automatic downloading, can make use of RSS feeds. The RSS feed link is dynamic which means that it will - like the search function - adapt to the current view, search results included.

                    | BBCode user input is parsed by the chatbox, torrent descriptions, information links, and torrent comments, and they all support basic BBCode like:

                      li 200 OK: The ID of the uploaded torrent can be found in the Record-ID header.

                      li

                        | 520 Configuration Broken: Server-side error. Wait for a few minutes, and then notify Nyaa if the problem did not go away.
